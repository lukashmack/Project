    <h1>What is my website about?</h1>
    <p>
        This site's objective is to take my newsletter to the next level. Substack has been outstanding by providing a uniform design with little work. However, the time is ripe to utilize my budding HTML and CSS skills to improve it. I hope to reflect my tastes and preferences through the construction of this site. The site will house my weekly sports newsletter, which uses palatable data analytics for casual fans. I write primarily about baseball, football, and soccer.
    </p>
    <h1>What is the objective of my website?</h1>
    <p>
        In addition to providing me total control over customization, my site will aid my payment processing. My ultimate goal is to transition into a freemium model where the weekly newsletter will be free, but my primers will cost around $2 a month. Substack takes a 30% cut of all payment transfers; I could use a solution like Stripe to facilitate transactions. In this case, Stripe charges 2.9% and 30 cents per transaction -- a far cry from Substack's predatory pricing.

    <h1>Who is my target audience?</h1>
    <p>
        My target audience is people between the ages of 20-39 who are avid sports fans but want to improve their understanding of the intersection of analytics and sports. I have around 100 subscribers currently. 
    </p>
    <h1>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h1>
    <p>
        The five pages will be as follows:
        <li>Current Edition</li>
        <li>Past Editions</li>
        <li>Live Q&A</li>
        <li>Subscribe / Payment</li>
        <li>About Me </li>
